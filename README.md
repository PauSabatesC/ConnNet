# **Probably the easiest and fastest way to work with sockets in C#.**

### This library is a wrapper of common tcp and network streams libaries in order to act as a more high-level and user friendly api to deal with socket communications.

## Features
- **Production ready** library. Forget to waste time testing buffers and tcp framing communication, we cover you.
- **Asynchronous** connections and petitions.
- **User friendly API** with many method overloads to satisfy all user use cases.
- **Client and Server** sockets creation. Use it just for your .Net Client or for both client and server!
