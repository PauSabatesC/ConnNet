### A C# client library that is a high level abstraction of the most common communication protocols. ConnNet is probably the fastest way to create client side connections in c#

Goals:
- Asyncrhonous and Synchronous petitions.
- Generic return type parameters
- Handle secure protocols
- Automatic retries for connection issues
- Socket support
- FTP support
- REST support
- WebSockets support

In progress: documentation for usability of the library.
